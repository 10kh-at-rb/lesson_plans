## Learning Goals

* Understand how to seed data in Rails in a timely manner
* Know when to update the seed file in the development process
* How to use Faker
* How to set up relationships

## Structure

* 10 - Live Code: Building an Inefficient Seed File
* 10 - Lecture: Why Seeding Efficiently Matters
* 5 - Break
* 60 - Live Code: Improving the seed file with loops
* 90 - Code: Implement seeding strategies on The Pivot

## Live Code: Building an Inefficient Seed File

* Build each record by hand
* Setup all relationships by hand

## Lecture: Why Seeding Data Efficiently Matters

* Setting up each record by hand takes too much initial time
* This Approach Makes Maintenance difficult (each migration creates work)
