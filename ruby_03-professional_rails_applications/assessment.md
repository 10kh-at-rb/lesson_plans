# Module 3 Assessment

In this assessment you will:

* Use test-driven development
* Demonstrate mastery of all parts of the Rails stack
* Demonstrate mastery of Ruby throughout the process

## Areas of Knowledge

You will have to be prepared to pair with your facilitator and demonstrate a solid working understanding of the following:

* Producing an API
* Consuming an API
* Testing an API
* Storing data in a Rails Session
* Using ActiveRecord to filter data (`.where`, `.find_by`, `.includes`, `.joins`) and run [calculations](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Calculations.html)
* How to avoid [common security pitfalls](fundamental_rails_security.md)
* Be able to explain all lines of code in your project
* Any requirements from the previous two Modules

## Expectations

* The facilitator may ask you to:
  * work on a new feature in your queue
  * explain existing code in your project
  * refactor existing code in your project
* As you work, you *should*:
  * Think out loud so your facilitator can understand your process
  * Ask questions to your facilitator
  * Reference external public resources (ie: Google, Ruby API, etc)
  * Use the tooling most comfortable to you (Editor/IDE, testing framework, support tools like Guard, etc)
* As you work, you *should not*:
  * Copy code snippets
  * Seek live support from individuals other than your facilitator
  * Review implementations on old projects
* After you complete the exercise, please use discretion with your classmates to allow them an authentic evaluation experience

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby demonstrating a broad/deep understanding of available language features
* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby structures with a minimum of API reference, debugging, or support
* 2: Developer is able to write Ruby structures, but needs some support with method names/concepts or debugging syntax
* 1: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but spends significant time debugging syntax or looking up elementary methods/concepts
* 0: Developer struggles with basic Ruby syntax

### 2. Ruby Style

* 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components
* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but theyâ€™re written after or in the middle of implementation
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development

### 5. Problem Solving

* 4: Developer is able to create and implement strategies, and actively reassess/revise them
* 3: Developer is able to both create and implement problem solving strategies
* 2: Developer needs help with some details, but is able to build a strategy
* 1: Developer understands the big-picture, but struggles to put together a strategy
* 0: Developer struggles to come up with a cohesive problem-solving approach

### 6. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
* 2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
* 1: Developer is able to integrate unsolicited feedback but does not really collaborate
* 0: Developer needs more than two reminders to "think out loud" or struggles to articulate their process

### 7. Progression

* 4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.
* 1: Developer struggles to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.
* 0: Developer is not able to implement basic functionality.
