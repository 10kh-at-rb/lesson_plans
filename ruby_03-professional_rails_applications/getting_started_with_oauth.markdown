## Warmup

Begin by answering the following questions:

1. Why do we use passwords?
2. What does it mean to say we then *trust* the service provider?
3. Why does having more and more systems with logins make the average person
*less* secure?
4. How does OAuth help?
5. Why is OAuth advantageous for a startup business?

## Key Terms & Concepts

* OAuth
* Brokering trust
* User, Consumer, and Provider
* Token
* (Encryption) Key & Secret

## Discussion Plan

1. Discuss OAuth at a high level including issues of trust, passwords, and
users' security considerations
2. Discuss why/how OAuth came about and how to recognize it
3. Walk through the OAuth flow
4. Outline the necessary steps to be an OAuth consumer
5. Discuss what it'd look like to be an OAuth provider
6. Take a quick look at OmniAuth
