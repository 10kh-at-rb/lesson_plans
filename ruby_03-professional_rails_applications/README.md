## Module 3 Scope and Sequence

### Overview

In Module 3, students learn professional web development through Ruby on Rails. Students learn how to work on legacy code, consume and produce APIs, implement complex business intelligence in ActiveRecord, and improve the performance of their app through AJAX, caching and background workers. By the end of the module, students will be comfortable taking a business need and turn it into a product.

### Goals

Students will be able to:

* interpret a business need and develop a solid product using agile processes.
* contrast the different approaches between working on greenfield and brownfield projects.
* describe how multitenancy changes design in Rails.
* construct a Rails app using multitenancy authorization.
* use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM.
* critique previous projects for fundamental security flaws and understand how to prevent them.
* develop and test secure internal APIs using Rails.
* consume external APIs and test the consumption.
* describe what happens when an email is sent.
* modify elements of the DOM using AJAX calls within a Rails app.
* explain when to use caching strategies to improve performance in Rails.
* explain the scenarios that would benefit from using background workers in Rails.
