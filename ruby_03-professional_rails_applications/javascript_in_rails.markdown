## Javascript in Rails

This is a shell lesson plan for the JS in Rails lesson which currently exists
as a slide deck.

Topics covered

* Unobtrusive JS (separation of Document structure from UI behavioral layer)

Would like to add

* Discussion of progressive enhancement
* More small examples of different JS functionality
* Higher-level discussion of how Rails organizes your assets and how
  they get served to the client (recap of Understanding Asset Pipeline lesson)

## Resources
