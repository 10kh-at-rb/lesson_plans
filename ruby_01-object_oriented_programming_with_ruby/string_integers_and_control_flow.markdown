## Learning Goals

* Understand what strings and integers are in Ruby
* Know the difference between a single and double quoted string
* Know why integers are preferable to floats
* Be able to write an if-else statement

## Topics

We'll cherry-pick material from Ruby in 100 Minutes:

* [Variables](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#2.-variables)
* [Strings](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#3.-strings)
* [Numbers](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#5.-numbers)
* [Conditionals](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#9.-conditionals)

## Challenge

You have *most* of the tools now to solve the well-known "fizzbuzz" challenge. It goes like this:

* For the numbers 1 through 100...
* If the number is divisible by 3, print "fizz"
* If the number is divisible by 5, print "buzz"
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz"
* Otherwise print the number

Start with this template:

```
(1..100).each do |number|
# Your code here
end
```
