## Workshop: Building a Four-Bit Binary Adder

In this session we're going to do some hands-on work with basic electronics. In particular we'll be learning about some of the low-level operations of a computer by building a simple "calculator" which can add binary numbers.

### Materials

Each group should have the following materials:

* Integrated Circuit (IC) 74LS86 __(2)__
* IC 74LS08 __(2)__
* IC 74LS32  __(1)__
* 4-position DIP switch __(2)__
* LEDs __(5)__
* 22-gauge Wire Jumpers __(bunch)__
* Power Source __(1)__
* USB A to USB A Power Cord __(1)__
* Breadboard __(1)__

## Intro - Breadboard and Circuit Basics

Instructor demonstrates basic principles of breadboards including:

* Connecting power supply to the board
* Connecting Positive and Ground to power rails
* Jumping rails to second sections if needed
* Using resistors and LEDs

Students should demonstrate this knowledge by using their board to power on an LED in series with a resistor.
