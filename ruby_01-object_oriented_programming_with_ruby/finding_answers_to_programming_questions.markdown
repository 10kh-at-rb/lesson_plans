## Goals

* use resources such as documentation, StackOverflow, and blog posts to find answers to programming questions

## Discussion

### The Internet is a Cool Place

* Googling
  - understand what you're trying to do
  - include "ruby"
* Blog posts
  - who wrote it
  - date
* StackOverflow
  - question/answer format
  - upvote
  - comments
* Ruby Docs
  - version
  
### Try It!

Find a blog post, a stack overflow post, and the Ruby Docs that show you how to produce the following time/date formatted strings using Ruby. 

```ruby
wrap_up = Time.new(2016, 5, 11, 16, 05)
=> 2016-05-11 16:05:00 -0600

# use wrap_up variable and a formatter to produce this:
=> "2016-05-13"

# use wrap_up variable and a formatter to produce this:
=> "05/13/16"

# use wrap_up variable and a formatter to produce this:
=> "16:05" (24-hour time)

# use wrap_up variable and a formatter to produce this:
=> "4:05 pm"

# use wrap_up variable and a formatter to produce this:
=> "05/13/16 5:10 pm"
```

#### Discuss with your pair

1. What techniques worked well for finding the three resources? 
2. Out of the three types of resources, which resource was most helpful? Why? 
3. How do you know that the resources are relevant and/or accurate? 

### Other Things 

* Don't copy
  - muscle memory
  - things can go wrong
* Error messages
  - what part of error message to Google
* Timebox the struggle
* Mentors
  - delete their code and try it again
