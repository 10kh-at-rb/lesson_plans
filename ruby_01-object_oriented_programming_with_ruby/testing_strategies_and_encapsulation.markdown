## Learning Goals

* Be able to execute a strategy for writing tests and implementation
* Be able to build a small component of a larger system in isolation

## Topics

### Strategies for Testing

* What are you trying to build? Why?
* How will you know when it works?
* What's the smallest/simplest representation of the input?
* What is the start state / input?
* What are the processes / steps?
* Are the results correct?
* What's the next most difficult input?

### Isolating a Component

* Can we identify the input?
* Can we identify the output?
* The "interface"

## Challenges

* Rendering [URL Autolinks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#url-autolinking)
* Handling [strikethrough text](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#strikethrough)
* Parsing [markdown images](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img)
