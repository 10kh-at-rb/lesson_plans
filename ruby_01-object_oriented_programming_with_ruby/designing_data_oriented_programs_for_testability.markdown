## Outline

This lesson is divided into 3 sections:

1. Short warm-up discussion (10 - 15 minutes)
2. Student Exercise (20 - 30 minutes)
3. Live Coding Demo applying the principles to the Headcount project (60 - 90 minutes)

## Discussion - Testing vs. External Dependencies

__Q & A__ (call a random student for each question)

* What makes a piece of code easy to test?
* What makes it hard?
* What is an "Edge Case"?
* How do we test an edge case?
* Does this change when our objects have to deal with
  importing data from the outside world?
* Student 1: Describe 1 way to organize the relationship between
  an object and data it imports from the outside world?
* Student 2: Describe another way to do it?
