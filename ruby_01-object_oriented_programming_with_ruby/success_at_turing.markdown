## Structural Components

### Educational Approach

* You learn by doing
* Gradual release of responsibility
* Spiraling of expertise
* Community-driven education

### Modules

* 6 weeks
* Each is pass/fail
* Built up a portfolio
* Present that portfolio to argue for promotion
* M1 and M2 highly structured, M3 more independence, M4 very independent

### Weeks

* Monday & Tuesday are more instructional
* Wednesday & Thursday have more work and evaluation/feedback time
* Friday is community day

### Classes

* Typical class is 90-minutes with one instructor focused on one topic
* Classes are supposed to be "just in time" to apply the skill to your project
* Classes may be lecture, code-along, tutorial, small group work, etc

### Projects

* Projects are where you cement your learning
* Typically 1-2 weeks long
* Evaluated by an instructor
* Building blocks of your portfolio

### Echo/Foxtrot

* Why? Harvey Mudd & graduation rates
* Come in off the diving board or the zero-entry
* Everyone ends up in the same pool
* Some classes together, so separate
* Starting Week 4 the boundary starts getting erased
* Week 5/6 there is no Echo/Foxtrot
