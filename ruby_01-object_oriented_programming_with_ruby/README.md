## Module 1 Scope and Sequence

#### Overview

In Module 1, students are introduced to Ruby and Object Oriented Programming through data structures and algorithms
and learn best practices in testing methodologies. Through the use of projects during the module,
students also learn how to manage their projects, use git, and pair effectively with their project partners.

#### Big Goals

Students will be able to:

* create a Ruby program using the principles of Object Oriented Programming.
* critique in a specific, actionable, and kind way the code of their peers.
* demonstrate how to use a github with their projects.
* create software tests that will drive the design of their applications
* assemble tasks using a project management tool.
* explain how basic data structures work and implement some of them in Ruby
* compose programs using Ruby to manipulate strings in complex manners.
* implement an object relational model
* communicate with their pair effectively
