## Goals

By the end of this session we will have established four mastery projects that'll
guide your last three weeks in the program.

## Protocol

Before today you've cooked up a few ideas. Now let's refine them.

### Part 1: Solo

Take the first 15 minutes to summarize and post your ideas. For *each one* create
an Issue on https://github.com/turingschool/mastery_project and, in the description,
summarize the idea in the following format:

* Name:
* Problem it solves:
* How it solves it:
* Technical challenges:

### Part 2: Small Groups

Then get together in assigned groups of three to:

* Review/discuss each of your ideas
* Refine them
* Add comments to the issue
* Select your two favorites (from the entire group, they could be from the same person)

Tag your two favorites with the label "group_favorite".

### Part 3: Pitch & Merge

Then we'll get back together and each group of three will come up to pitch their
two ideas. Spend less than two minutes on each pitch.

After pitches, we'll merge any ideas that are very similar.

### Part 4: Voting

Then we'll plot the 12 ideas on the board. Each of you should then pass through
and mark the **three** ideas **you most want to exist**.

After all votes are cast, the top two vote getters are selected.

### Part 5: Teaming

Using a randomly generated list, you'll select your project. No project may
have more than four people.

### Part 6: Wireframing & Design

With the project and team established, get together with your group to wireframe
the key screens / interactions and figure out how you'll implement services.

Below are the key concepts from our instructional sessions which may inform some
of your thinking:

* Designing a Service Oriented Architecture
* Service/API Interaction Patterns
* Accessing APIs from JavaScript
* Building a JavaScript Front-End
* MVC in Ember.js
* Templating with Handlebars
* Ember Data
* Routing in Ember
* End-User Performance Analysis
* Database Performance Pitfalls
* Database Replication & Load Balancing
* Using a Content-Delivery Network

### Part 7: Workflow

Steve will create repositories for the selected projects. If you have a clever name, now is the time.
