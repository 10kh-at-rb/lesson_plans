## Abstract

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using JavaScript exclusvely to complete this project.

This project is inspired by [Minicade](http://minica.de/).

## Goals

* Use client-side to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side applicaiton

### Restrictions

You can use any of the following libraries:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/)
* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)
* [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com)

(Other libraries may be used only with instructor apporval.)

## Game Options

You can choose to implement any of the games listed below.

* Connect Four
* Lights Out
* Sudoku Checker
* Othello/Reversi
* 2048

(Other idea and suggestions are available with instructor approval.)

## Extensions

* Create multiple rounds of difficulty.
* Create an AI player that can play as the second player (except in 2048).

## Evaluation Rubric

### Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension
* 3: Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
* 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage

### Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly-named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4: Zero complaints
* 3: Five or fewer complaints
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints
