## Learning Goals

* Be able to explain why we'd want to generate SQL
* Understand the role of an Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
* Be able to generate `SELECT` and `INSERT` statements with `WHERE` using Sequel

## Structure

* 5 - Warmup
* 20 - Lecture
* 5 - Break
* 25 - Fundamental SQL Tutorial
* 5 - Break
* 20 - Fundamental SQL Tutorial
* 5 - Wrapup

## Warmup

Create a Gist answering the following questions:

1. What's hard about SQL? Why is that a big deal?
2. What kind of programming is SQL? Why's that a difficult match for Object-Oriented
programming like Ruby?
3. What are some of the common options for Object-Relational Mappers? Why would
you choose one over the other?

## Lecture

* SQL is no fun
* Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)
* ActiveRecord (99%), DataMapper (1%), Sequel (0%)
* Why use Sequel?

## Independent Work

Get together with your pair to complete the
[Sequel tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/sequel.html).

### Extra Challenge

Return to the SQL tutorial and try to re-implement each of those steps using
Sequel instead of raw SQL.

## Wrapup

Return to your Gist from Warmup and improve your answers.
