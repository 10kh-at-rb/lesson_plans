## Learning Goals

* Be able to explain why we'd want to generate SQL
* Understand the role of an Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
* Be able to generate `SELECT` and `INSERT` statements with `WHERE` using Sequel

## Structure

* 5 - Warmup
* 20 - Lecture
* 5 - Break
* 25 - Sequel Tutorial
* 5 - Break
* 20 - Sequel Tutorial
* 5 - Wrapup

## Warmup

With a partner, discuss the following questions: 

1. What's hard about SQL? Why is that a big deal?
2. Why would SQL be a difficult match for Object-Oriented programming like Ruby?

## Key Points

* SQL is no fun
* Declarative programming vs. Object-oriented programming
* Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)
* ActiveRecord (99%), DataMapper (1%), Sequel (0%)
* Why use Sequel? 

## Independent Work

Get together with your pair to complete the
[Sequel tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/sequel.html).

### Extra Challenge

Return to the SQL tutorial and try to re-implement each of those steps using
Sequel instead of raw SQL.
