### Goals

* Explore a new codebase.
* Refactor your project with the help of your pair.

### Structure

#### How do we approach a new project?

Let's get started by watching an instructor jump into a new project.

#### Pair refactor and code review

* Take this time to get with your pair begin a code review. Make sure you split the time remaining for this evenly.

##### What should I be looking for?

* Refactoring opportunities.
  * logic in views such calculations, formatting, or queries
  * unclear method or variable names
  * long methods or __unclear/unconcise__ code
  * too much login in controllers
  * Bad or hard to read formatting
* Look for things your pair did different than you did.
* How did the other person test their application?
* Refactoring within tests
