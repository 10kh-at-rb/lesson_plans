## Learning Goals

* Understand the common roles of a team in a professional setting
* Discuss possible arrangements for working in groups at Turing
* __Understand the importance of taking a front to back approach to projects__
* Why not start by creating all of your migrations up front?

## Reading/Video

* [Watch this quick video and read the article.](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm)
* [Tuckman's Development Model](http://salvos.org.au/scribe/sites/2020/files/Resources/Transitions/HANDOUT_-_Tuckmans_Team_Development_Model.pdf)

### Common Roles on a Team

* **Client** - Who the software is being built for. (Instructors at Turing)
* **Product Owner** - Translates the needs for the client to the team (this piece can usually be skipped at Turing). Often is responsible for confirming that the stories meet the client's needs (Having someone check your work is important).
* **Team Lead** - Commonly in charge of estimation and making sure the dev team is on track. Commonly the go between for the team and the Product Owner and sometimes the Client.
* **Developers** - Responsible for working on stories. Multiple devs will review other team members pull requests.
* **Designers** - They design things.


### Stages of the Group Lifecycle
[Tuckman's Group Lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)
* Forming
* Storming
* Norming
* Performing

### Big Picture Workflow

- Show how to convert the requirements of the project to stories/issues on Waffle
- Discuss the advantages of designing the schema after the stories have been written and the problems are well understood
- Let the stories drive development, even copy and paste the story into the tests
- Do not create migrations before you have a story written. Why not create all "necessary" migrations right up front?
