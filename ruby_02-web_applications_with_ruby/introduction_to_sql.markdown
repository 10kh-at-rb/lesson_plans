## Warmup

Create a Gist answering the following questions:

1. What are database tables, column, and rows? What's the purpose of each?
2. How's a database similar and different from a spreadsheet?
3. What's the meaning and purpose of `SELECT`? What about `WHERE?`
4. What's a foreign key? What's it used for?

## Lecture

Let's discuss the big picture of SQL:

* Excel and Databases
* Tables, Columns, and Rows
* Data types
* Primary keys
* SELECT, INSERT, DELETE
* WHERE
* Foreign keys
* Joins

## Independent Work

Get together with your pair to complete the
[Fundamental SQL tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html)
tutorial.

### Extra Challenge

Create a table of Customers and a table of Orders. Can you execute a `JOIN` that
connects the two into one set of results?

## Wrapup

Return to your Gist from Warmup and improve your answers.
