    what it is

* Test Driving our gem
  * Dropping down to unit tests
    * to get feedback about our design
    * to make it easy to verify features do what we expect, with minimal overhead
    * the thought process of writing tests
  * Our testing will follow what's I do in reality.
    I treat all religions with iconoclasm, TDD is no exception --
    we will test our code this way because it is incredibly effective,
    not because someone will shame us if we don't.
